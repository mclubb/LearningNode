# LearningNode

This is my attempt at learning node and what it can do.

## Coding Journal

Install Nodejs and NPM

Created Project by starting with package.json and setting up a very generic file

Added the following packages
- express
- http
- jade
- mysql

Created a HTTP server from examples found on the internet

Created a route to an index page

Learned how to use jade a bit (still learning) 

Created a todo list view with no styles what so ever
- Created a mysql database and table structure
- Input and a button to add a task
- List out current entries in database

Added the config package
- Removed hardcoded entries to local mysql db in favor of using the config package

Install MongoDB

Learned how to use MongoDB

Removed MySQL from the app and replaced with mongodb calls

Added CSS and Javascript files
- Make the task list look pretty
- Make ajax calls to update the status of a task
